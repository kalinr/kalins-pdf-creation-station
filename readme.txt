== Description ==

<p>
Build highly customizable PDF documents from any combination of pages and posts, or add a link to any page to download a PDF of that post.                  
</p>
<p>
Kalin's PDF Creation Station will add two menus to your WordPress admin. One under tools and one under settings. 
</p>
<p>In the tools menu you will be able to build PDF (or .html and .txt) documents from any combination of pages and posts. Select any or all pages and posts from your site, then add a custom title page, end page and custom headers. Adjust font sizes, file names, or insert information such as timestamps, excerpts and urls through the use of shortcodes. Save your document as a template for future use or create your PDF, TXT or HTML documents. All created files will display in a convenient list for you to delete, download or link to.
</p>
<p>
In the settings menu you will be able to setup options for a link that can be automatically added to some or all pages and posts. This link will point to an automatically generated PDF version of that page. Most of the same customization options are available here that are available in the creation tool, like title page and font size, as well as the option to fully customize the link itself. On individual page/post edit pages you will be able to override the default link placement so you can show links on some pages and not on others. PDF files are saved to your server so they only need to be created once, reducing server load compared to other PDF generation plugins that create a new PDF every time the link is clicked. The PDF file is automatically deleted when a page or post is edited, so the PDF always matches the page.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `kalins-pdf-creation-station.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find the PDF Creation Station menu under 'tools' and begin creating custom PDF documents of your website. Or go into the PDF Creaction Station menu under 'settings' and begin setting up the options for automatic individual page generation.

Note: probably requires PHP 5.2 and WordPress 3.0.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find instructions and help? =

In both the settings and tool pages you can find help in the built-in wordpress help dropdown menu in the upper right side of the screen. If you continue to have problems, feel free to make a comment at http://kalinbooks.com/pdf-creation-station/. Try to include as much specific information as you can, especially if you think you've found a bug.

= Font, href or align tags don't work in inserted HTML. =

Make sure to use double quotes instead of single quotes when inserting arbitrary HTML attributes because of a bug with the core PDF creation engine (TCPDF).

== Screenshots ==

1. A portion of the creator tool that creates custom PDF documents from multiple pages and posts. This shows the post list section and some collapsed sections.
2. This is the main section of the multi-create tool showing options and the list of your created files.
3. The main section of the settings page where you set up PDF links that can appear on every page and post.
4. A different shot of the settings page.
5. The configuration box for the widget.
6. A shot of the box that is added to the page/post edit page to specifically control link placement for each page.
